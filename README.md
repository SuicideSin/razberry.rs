*razberry.rs* is an HTTP client library for the [Razberry 
Z-Wave hub](http://razberry.z-wave.me/). It utilizes the exposed "zdev" JSON
API to query sensor device states. In the future this library may be extended
to set parameters for both the Razberry hardware and associated devices.

I'm only implementing the minimum feature set necessary for querying a Aeotec 
multisensor / PIR motion sensor. If I get additional Z-Wave hardware, I may
extend the library to be more full-featured. In the meantime, I'll be happy to
accept pull requests.
